# Events

- system produces or fires a signal
- provides a mechanism by which an action can be automatically taken
- each event is represented by an object that is based on the Event Interface
- react to an event - attach an event handler/listener
  - `object.addEventListener("event", callback)`
  - `object.removeEventListener("event", callback)`
  - aborting using a controller
    - `AbortController` object
    - passing a `AbortSignal` using the above `obj.abort()`
    - controllers can be registered to events
  - removing eventListeners can be useful for
    - improve efficiency
    - register different controllers for the same event based on context
- event handler functions can also be registered using the event handler properties
  - `btn.onclick = fn`
  - multiple functions cannot be registered like this for the events
- inline event handlers
  - directly calling the event handler functions from html code
  - \<button onclick="fn()"\>
  - don't use; bad practice
- event object is automatically passed to event handlers
- default mode of certain events is to refresh the page for doing a http request
  - `event.preventDefault()` stops that, and is good to use in practice
- event bubbling / propagation
  - nested events are caught by parent as well, if listener exists
  - context passed is where the event is caught
  - can be prevented using `stopPropagation()`
- event capture
  - opposite of event bubbling / propagation
  - the parent event listener catches the event first
  - done by passing `{capture:true}` to the event listener object
- event delegation
  - event is captured by the parent for all nested children
  - some logic to implement child specific action
